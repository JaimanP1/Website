This is mostly just a place to store my notes and solutions to _Measure, Integral, and Probability, 2nd Edition_ by Marek Capinski and Peter Kopp. 

The overview document will be notes regarding the conceptual approach to working in the measure and related spaces of the subject. The specific chapter documents will be my own solutions to the exercises in the book. 

Note that there are already solutions available in the back of the book, but they are often only answers and not a full explanation.
