Well, you might ask, understand what? That is easy: everything. 

I view Wigner's famous observation of _The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences_[^1] as a sort of axiom when it comes to modeling. Any (falsiable) model is a mathematical model. One can get lost in the philosophy of whether such a statement is valid, but given the tremendous overlap of math and physics, which has no doubt biased my opinion, it certainly seems a justified basis.

To that end, my personal approach to modeling mirrors a physical theory. A physical theory will define objects and the interactions of those objects. In mathematical terms, the objects are elements of a space, while interactions are operators. Thus, specification of an appropriate space and operator defines a theory. Of course, such specification is highly non-trivial, but for an estabished theory, if one understands the (mathematical) space and the operator, they understand the (physical) theory.

We might now ask which physical theory we would like to study, keeping in mind we may be as impressionable as it. That is, the theory may shape our thinking as much as our thinking shapes the physics. To this, Weinberg gives good advice in his _Four Golden Lessons_: aim for rough waters.[^2] We should look for theory that still is incomplete, in some sense, for those have work yet to be done. Moreover, I require that if something is to occupy my time, it should yield tangible results. I want to focus on problems which not just change our understanding of the world, but also the way we interact with it. Emphasizing the latter, statistical field theory emerges as a winner. 

Finally, we are at a position to 'build' our model. Recognizing that statistical physics will guide the approach, we look for compatible spaces and operators. As the name suggests, statistics, and probability, will play a major role. The branch of math which deals with the space these two subjects occur on is measure theory. On the operator side, we know from the works of Weyl[^3] that classifying interactions, usually by symmetry, yields a richer theory than studying each in isolation. The branch of mathematics that deals with this is group theory.

With [measure theory](/Website/projects/measure-theory/) and [group theory](/Website/projects/group-theory/), we have the necessary, and ideally sufficient, tools to build a statistically-motivated model of tangible phenomena. The question is then which phenomena in particular, which I may elaborate on in another post.
