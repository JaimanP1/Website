Over the fall semester of my senior year, as part of a final group project, we had to create an application tracking system. It should be a platform on which applicants can track which jobs they have applied to, upcoming interviews, and their resume versions. 

As the course went on, we added features to grow your professional network, perform market research, and automate their application workflow. 

The app is a full-stack web application built for our CS490 capstone that showcases a modern, scalable tech stack. The frontend is written in TypeScript and JavaScript, while the backend combines server-side logic with a PostgreSQL database (via PL/pgSQL) to manage data. The app is deployed on Vercel for fast, global delivery and features a structured architecture with separate frontend, backend, and database layers for a real-world example of a production-style web project. I was responsible for working on many of the frontend features.
