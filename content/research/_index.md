Research projects done as part of the honors curricula for classes or through summer research fellowships. 

Most of the research I have participated in has been within the field of PDEs, specifically in those that arise in a fluid context. The largest of these projects is that of solar plasmas, where I have been modeling coronal mass ejections as a magnetohydrodynamic system. 

A notable outlier was my last honors project, where I worked with my professor to conduct a literature review of game theory in the social sciences. I anticipate this to be a subject which exerts great influence over my future interests and want to explore how my previous research may complement this theme.
