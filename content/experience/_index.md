A brief overview of my professional experience. My most recent summer was spent as an intern at the Naval Nuclear Laboratory in Pittsburgh, where I helped write and implement hyperparameter optimization algorithms. For most of my undergraduate degree I have been a research assistant at the Center for Solar-Terrestrial Physics at NJIT, as well as a tutor for the math department. 

I also have some experience as a sales associate and as an IT technician.
