      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the fall semester of my senior year, as part of a final group project, we had to create an application tracking system. It should be a platform on which applicants can track which jobs they have applied to, upcoming interviews, and their resume versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the course went on, we added features to grow your professional network, perform market research, and automate their application workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app is a full-stack web application built for our CS490 capstone that showcases a modern, scalable tech stack. The frontend is written in TypeScript and JavaScript, while the backend combines server-side logic with a PostgreSQL database (via PL/pgSQL) to manage data. The app is deployed on Vercel for fast, global delivery and features a structured architecture with separate frontend, backend, and database layers for a real-world example of a production-style web project. I was responsible for working on many of the frontend features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
