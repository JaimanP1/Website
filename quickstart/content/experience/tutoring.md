I have been a tutor for the mathematics department at NJIT since 2023. I have assisted in recitations and worked with students individually at the tutoring center for classes such as calculus (1/2/3), linear algebra, (partial) differential equations, and more. Additionally, I have assisted at the physics tutoring center in subjects such as mechanics and electromagnetics.
