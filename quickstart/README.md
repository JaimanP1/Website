# Instructions

Using Hugo to build the site.

## New page
In the root git directory, do `hugo new dir/page.md`

Note that the `dir` refers to the specific `content/dir/`, but `content/` is omitted.

## Push to gh-pages
First commit to `main` and push to remote.

Then `cd public/` and commit to `gh-pages` and push.
